/**
 * A thread-local stack for managing R2dbcTransaction objects.
 *
 * Each thread keeps its own stack so transactions are isolated per thread.
 * Coroutines that hop threads must pair every push with a pop to avoid leaks.
 *
 * Intended usage:
 * - At the start of work in a coroutine context, push the active transaction.
 * - After the work completes, pop it exactly once.
 *
 * To avoid misuse and potential memory leaks, prefer using the utilities:
 * - withTransactionContext(...)
 * - withThreadLocalTransaction(...)
