* Spring Boot 3.1.3

Breaking changes:
* `SpringTransactionManager` no longer extends `DataSourceTransactionManager`; instead, it directly extends `AbstractPlatformTransactionManager`.
  The class also no longer implements the Exposed interface `TransactionManager`, as transaction operations are instead delegated to Spring.
* `spring-transaction` and `exposed-spring-boot-starter` modules now use Spring Framework 6.0 and Spring Boot 3.0, which require Java 17 as a minimum version.
* A table that is created with a keyword identifier now logs a warning that the identifier's case may be lost when it is automatically quoted in generated SQL.
  `DatabaseConfig` now includes the property `preserveKeywordCasing`, which can be set to `true` to remove these warnings and to ensure that the identifier matches the exact case used.

# 0.41.1
Infrastructure:
* Kotlin 1.7.21 
* spring-security-crypto 5.7.3
* Few improvements in text infrastructure with help of [valery1707](https://github.com/valery1707)

Deprecations:
* `StatementInterceprot.afterCommit` and `StatementInterceptor.afterRollback` without `transaction` parameter have ERROR deprecation level
* `Column<*>.autoIncSeqName` has HIDDEN deprecation level
* `Database.connect` with `datasource: ConnectionPoolDataSource` parameter has HIDDEN deprecation level
* `SchemaUtils.createFKey` with `reference: Column<*>` parameter has ERROR deprecation level
* `Sequence.nextVal` has ERROR deprecation level
* `SqlExpressionBuilderClass` has ERROR deprecation level
* `CurrentDateTime()`  has ERROR deprecation level 

Feature:
* [PostgreSQL] `NOWAIT/SKIP LOCKED` modes supported in all kinds of `FOR UPDATE`. Also, it's now possible to provide tables to be locked ([#1623](https://github.com/JetBrains/Exposed/issues/1623)) 
*`ExposedBlob` now wraps `InputStream` instead of `ByteArray` that can lead to significant memory improvements ([#1617](https://github.com/JetBrains/Exposed/issues/1617))
* [H2] All [compatibility modes](http://www.h2database.com/html/features.html#compatibility) are fully supported for known dialects ([#1615](https://github.com/JetBrains/Exposed/issues/1615))
* `mod`/`rem` operations with `EntityID` expressions supported with help of [Alexey Soshin](https://github.com/AlexeySoshin) ([#1597](https://github.com/JetBrains/Exposed/issues/1597))

Bug Fixes:
* Don't alert entity hook subscribers while inserting new entities as it can lead to entity cache misses
* `clientDefault` should allow nullable values ([#1617](https://github.com/JetBrains/Exposed/issues/1617)). Reported and fixed by [terminalnode](https://github.com/terminalnode)
* [Oracle] Use VARCHAR2 column for VarCharColumnType ([#1628](https://github.com/JetBrains/Exposed/issues/1628)). Reported and fixed by [dakriy](https://github.com/dakriy)
* [PostgreSQL] Correct comparison of defaults for String type columns ([#1587](https://github.com/JetBrains/Exposed/issues/1587)). Resolved by [Alexey Soshin](https://github.com/AlexeySoshin)
* Transaction was initialized with a wrong isolation level ([#1575](https://github.com/JetBrains/Exposed/issues/1575))

# 0.40.1
Infrastructure:
* Kotlin 1.7.20

Feature:
* Read-only transactions/connections support. Read-Only option can be set on all levels (via `DatabaseConfig`, `transaction`, `TransactionManager`). Thanks [Alex Shubert](https://github.com/lure) for the improvement
* `Table.deleteWhere` now captures receiver table and allows to omit the table in a lambda. Greetings to [Alexey Soshin](https://github.com/AlexeySoshin) for the first PR in the project!  
    * **Breaking change**: Code using `deleteWhere` with `eq` will need to `import org.jetbrains.exposed.sql.SqlExpressionBuilder.eq`.
      Lambdas previously using an implicit `it` reference from an outer scope will also need to introduce an explicit name to access that binding.
* New `mediumText` and `largeText` columns were introduced by [Alex Shubert](https://github.com/lure) to allow use more suitable data types for databases where they are supported.
* `ForUpdateOption` (like `ForUpdateOption.PostgreSQL.ForKeyShare`) added for more flexible management of locks in your `SELECT` queries. You can set it as a parameter via `Query.forUpdate` function. Another kudos goes to [Alex Shubert](https://github.com/lure)
* Preserve a colection type for `Iterable.with()` function 
* `LazySizedCollection` can be checked for loaded data with `LazySizedCollection.isLoaded()`. Added by [unbearables](https://github.com/unbearables)

Bug Fixes:
* [Regression] `NoSuchMethod` error: `long kotlin.time.TimeSource$Monotonic.markNow` ([#1556](https://github.com/JetBrains/Exposed/issues/1540)) 
* `insertIgnoreAndGet` must explicitly mark failed insert on conflicts. Fixed by [Alex Shubert](https://github.com/lure) in PR ([#1584](https://github.com/JetBrains/Exposed/issues/1584))
* Comma is missing in `UPDATE` with multiple tables ([#1595](https://github.com/JetBrains/Exposed/issues/1595))
* `suspendedTransaction` should accept `CoroutineContext` instead of `CourutineDispatcher` was fixed by [rasharab](https://github.com/rasharab) in PR ([#1515](https://github.com/JetBrains/Exposed/issues/1515))
* [MySQL/MariaDB] `REPLACE` fails when `Expression` used as a replacement parameter. Thank you [Tiscs](https://github.com/Tiscs) for the fix.
* `EntityClass#wramUpReferences` should cache reference of referrer. Located and fixed by [Joddev](https://github.com/Joddev).  
* `NullPointerException` when IdTable with overridden tableName is defined ([#1588](https://github.com/JetBrains/Exposed/issues/1588))
* `SchemaUtils.createMissingTablesAndColumns` raises `NoSuchElementException` ([#1568](https://github.com/JetBrains/Exposed/issues/1568))
* Better handling of tables with names covered with quotes. Issue [#1550](https://github.com/JetBrains/Exposed/issues/1550) resolved by [Alexey Soshin](https://github.com/AlexeySoshin).

# 0.39.1
Infrastructure:
* Kotlin 1.7.10
* Kotlin Coroutines 1.6.4
* Datetime/Timestamp comparison test improvements by [Jerbell](https://github.com/Jerbell)  

Feature:
* `Transaction` added into `afterCommit` and `afterRollback` in `StatementInterceptor` ([#1530](https://github.com/JetBrains/Exposed/issues/1530)). PR by [rsromanowski](https://github.com/rsromanowski) 
* `andIfNotNull` and `orIfNotNull` operators was added by [xJoeWoo](https://github.com/xJoeWoo) to perform logical operations with nullable condition
* `like/notLike` support providing escape character when used with `LikePattern`. Improvement contributed by [spand](https://github.com/spand)
* `CurrentDate` function introduced by [naftalmm](https://github.com/naftalmm)
* Better representation of long query in logs 

Bug Fixes:
* `neq` incorrectly resolved with nullable values  ([#1489](https://github.com/JetBrains/Exposed/issues/1489))
* `newSuspendedTransaction` now accepts generic `CoroutineContext` instead of `CoroutineDispatcher`, fixed by [rasharab](https://github.com/rasharab)

* Creating tables with composite primary key and defined schema doesn't work. Fixed by [davidwheeler123](https://github.com/davidwheeler123)
* Eager loading of Parent-Child relations doen't work ([#1363](https://github.com/JetBrains/Exposed/issues/1363))
* Possible StackOverflowError when processing entities hooks which executes flush

# 0.38.2
Infrastructure:
* Kotlin Coroutines 1.6.1
* slf4j 1.7.36
* log4j2 2.17.2
* h2-database 2.1.212
* MaridDB driver 2.7.5
* MySQL driver 8.0.28
* PostgreSQL driver 42.3.3

Feature:
* New `optimizedLoad` param introduced for `EntityClass.warmUpLinkedReferences`. 
It will force to make to two queries to load ids and referenced entities separately.
Can be useful when references target the same entities. That will prevent from loading them multiple times 
(per each reference row) and will require less memory/bandwidth for "heavy" entities (with a lot of columns or columns with huge data in it)

Bug Fixes:
* Regression on 0.38.1 - SpringTransactionManager requires DatabaseConfig ([#1488](https://github.com/JetBrains/Exposed/issues/1488))
* `inList`/`notInList` doesn't work with list of EntityIDs ([#1490](https://github.com/JetBrains/Exposed/issues/1490))
* `eq`/`neq` was broken for nullable columns with nullable value ([#1489](https://github.com/JetBrains/Exposed/issues/1489))
* `Except` union operation doesn't work on Oracle
* ORA-00972: identifier is too long. Oracle 12.1.0.2.0 ([#1483](https://github.com/JetBrains/Exposed/issues/1483))
* Can't create arbitrary-size BINARY column in SQLite ([#1443](https://github.com/JetBrains/Exposed/issues/1443))


# 0.38.1
Infrastructure:
* Kotlin 1.6.20
* h2 updated to 2.1.210
* MariaDB driver 3.0.4 supported
* Exposed can be build on Java 17+ (`MaxPermSize` is optional in build scripts), thanks to [MrPowerGamerBR](https://github.com/MrPowerGamerBR)

Feature:
* New `exposed-crypt` module added. Module contains two new `encryptedVarchar` and `encryptedBinary` columns which allows to store encrypted values in database and encode/decode them on client. 
  Check [`SelectTests.test encryptedColumnType with a string`](https://github.com/JetBrains/Exposed/blob/0.38.1/exposed-tests/src/test/kotlin/org/jetbrains/exposed/sql/tests/shared/dml/SelectTests.kt#L264) test for the sample usage 
* Allow to pass DatabaseConfig in SpringTransactionManager. PR by [stengvac](https://github.com/stengvac)
* `CompoundBooleanOp` (`AndOp` and `OrOp`) is sealed class now
* Entity explicit constructor lambda can be defined on `EntityClass` via `entityCtor` parameter to prevent using reflection (for example). Improved by [m-sasha](https://github.com/m-sasha)
* `memoizedTransform` function similar to `transform` added. The delegate will cache value on read for the same value from DB.
* Reified versions of `enumeration` and `enumerationByName` functions
* `CurrentDateTime` became object instance

Performance:
* Faster initialization: reflection replaced with regular code in `Column<T>.cloneWithAutoInc`. Found and fixed by [m-sasha](https://github.com/m-sasha)
* ResultRow stores evaluated values in local cache 
* Prevent unnecessary calls to get current transaction isolation level. Problem located and fixed by [shunyy](https://github.com/shunyy)

Bug Fixes:
* Proper handling of Op.NULL in eq/neq and other places, found by [naftalmm](https://github.com/naftalmm)
* Wrong SortOrder representation in order by and group by
* SQLServer dialect now have default transaction isolation level READ_COMMITTED.
* Unable to use nullable reference with lookup ([#1437](https://github.com/JetBrains/Exposed/issues/1437)) fixed by [naftalmm](https://github.com/naftalmm)
* Wrong behavior when ColumnType returns null on read ([#1435](https://github.com/JetBrains/Exposed/issues/1435)), also fixed by [naftalmm](https://github.com/naftalmm)
* `closeAndUnregister` makes a thread local transaction manager completely dead ([#1476](https://github.com/JetBrains/Exposed/issues/1476))
* Call to `Entity.load` for new entities leads to exception ([#1472](https://github.com/JetBrains/Exposed/issues/1472))
* Broken behavior of `customEnumeration` for Enums with overridden `toString` ([#1475](https://github.com/JetBrains/Exposed/issues/1475)) 
* Another attempt to fix `optReference` column should allow update { it[column] = nullableValue } ([#1275](https://github.com/JetBrains/Exposed/issues/1275))

# 0.37.3
Bug Fixes:
* Many-to-many reference broken in version 0.37.1 ([#1413](https://github.com/JetBrains/Exposed/issues/1413))
* NPE on Enum columns initialization

# 0.37.2
Features:
* `adjustHaving`, `andHaving`, `orHaving` extension methods for `Query` added by [naftalmm](https://github.com/naftalmm)

Bug Fixes:
* Change default for `logTooMuchResultSetsThreshold` to 0 (no log)

# 0.37.1
Infrastructure:
* Major test infrastructure rework by [naftalmm](https://github.com/naftalmm). Now it's possible to run tests on any dialect directly from IDE.
* Kotlin 1.6.10
* Kotlin Coroutines 1.6.0
* kotlinx-datetime-jvm 0.3.1
* Spring framework 5.3.13
* Spring boot 2.6.1
* Detekt 1.19.0

Performance:
* Cache `enumConstants` values in `EnumerationColumnType` and `EnumerationNameColumnType` as it makes copy on access
* Better handling for opened result sets

Features:
* H2 2.x supported
* Composite foreign key supported by [naftalmm](https://github.com/naftalmm). Check the sample below.
```kotlin
object ParentTable : Table("parent1") {
    val idA = integer("id_a")
    val idB = integer("id_b")
    override val primaryKey = PrimaryKey(idA, idB)
}

object ChildTable : Table("child1") {
    val idA = integer("id_a")
    val idB = integer("id_b")

    init {
        foreignKey(
            idA, idB,
            target = ParentTable.primaryKey,
            onUpdate = ReferenceOption.RESTRICT,
            onDelete = ReferenceOption.RESTRICT,
            name = "MyForeignKey1"
        )
        
        // or
        foreignKey(
            idA to ParentTable.idA, idB to ParentTable.idB,
            onUpdate = ReferenceOption.RESTRICT,
            onDelete = ReferenceOption.RESTRICT,
            name = "MyForeignKey1"
        ) 
    }
}

```
* Now it's possible to use embedded entity initialization like:
```kotlin
val post = Post.new {
    parent = Post.new {

    defaultFetchSize = null // unlimited
    defaultIsolationLevel = -1 // DB specific
    defaultRepetitionAttempts = 3
    warnLongQueriesDuration = null // no long query tracing

* Fixed bug that call for createMissingTablesAndColumns could lead to exception while trying to add an index which already exists in db (*MySQL only problem*)

# 0.11.1
Features:
* Support entity references by non-ID column ([#282](https://github.com/JetBrains/Exposed/issues/282))
* groupConcat function reworked and supported on all databases (except SQLite)
* Now it's possible to create cyclic depended tables in single SchemaUtils.createTable() call. 
Relates to Defer Foreign references during creation ([#384](https://github.com/JetBrains/Exposed/issues/384))
* Introduced SchemaUtils.checkCycle() function to check tables for cyclic references
* MOD (%) operator support ([#391](https://github.com/JetBrains/Exposed/issues/391))

* Throw exception when trying to change onUpdate state for loaded LazySizedCollection
* Database.dialect field is now public

Bug fixes:
* BatchUpdateStatement results in IllegalStateException: Table.columnName is already initialized ([#386](https://github.com/JetBrains/Exposed/issues/386))
* BatchUpdateStatement expects set(..) calls in alphabetical order and fails when given more than 2 batches ([#388](https://github.com/JetBrains/Exposed/issues/388))
* autoIncrement carries to referencing column ([#385](https://github.com/JetBrains/Exposed/issues/385))
* Query fails when same column/expression provided in slice multiple times
* columnConstraints() returns wrong map with keys in wrong order (target instead of referee)
* Try to expand Query in ExposedSQLException even if it wasn't able to use current transaction.
* Autoinc column does not necessarily need to be the first column in the table ([#398](https://github.com/JetBrains/Exposed/issues/398))
* "No transaction in context" when using SpringTransactionManager ([#365](https://github.com/JetBrains/Exposed/issues/365), [#407](https://github.com/JetBrains/Exposed/issues/407))
* uuid values are not properly escaped in subquery ([#415](https://github.com/JetBrains/Exposed/issues/415))
* Foreign Key Constraints being recreated  ([#394](https://github.com/JetBrains/Exposed/issues/394))


# 0.10.5
Features:
* Added `DOUBLE` column type ([#358](https://github.com/JetBrains/Exposed/issues/358)). Thanks go to Jonathan Shore (@tr8dr).
* `Entity.refresh()` introduced to update its state from database (see kdoc)
* All statements classes become open to allowing inheritance ([#350](https://github.com/JetBrains/Exposed/issues/350))
* `where` part made optional in `UPDATE` statement ([#115](https://github.com/JetBrains/Exposed/issues/115))  
* `andWhere` function introduced to help in constructing complex queries ([#375](https://github.com/JetBrains/Exposed/issues/374)). 
See ["Conditional where"](https://github.com/JetBrains/Exposed/wiki/DSL#conditional-where) section on Wiki.    

Bug fixes:
* Varchar column doesn't validate length / Validate length only before execute update ([#300](https://github.com/JetBrains/Exposed/issues/300))
* sqlState doesn't available on `ExposedSQLException` ([#331](https://github.com/JetBrains/Exposed/issues/331))
* [SQLite] `ClassCastException` when reading from VARCHAR column ([#369](https://github.com/JetBrains/Exposed/issues/369))
* Use ::class instead of ::class.java for enumerations ([#370](https://github.com/JetBrains/Exposed/issues/370))
Previous functions `enumeration`/`enumerationByName` were deprecated with quick fix to new ones. Both functions will be removed on next releases.
* Multiple join produce "DSL SYNTAX ERROR" ([#366](https://github.com/JetBrains/Exposed/issues/366))  
* Entities flush to a database after a `DROP` table ([#112](https://github.com/JetBrains/Exposed/issues/112))   
* Entity id is not generated properly when using `clientDefault` on related column ([#313](https://github.com/JetBrains/Exposed/issues/313))
* `ClassCastExpection` when using alias on a expressions ([#379](https://github.com/JetBrains/Exposed/issues/379))
* [MySQL] Entity ids were not generated properly with `rewriteBatchedStatements` flag is on.
* [Oracle] `LONG` type replaced with `CLOB` for text columns ([#382](https://github.com/JetBrains/Exposed/issues/382))
   

# 0.10.4
Features:
* ON UPDATE reference constraint added
* All dialects made public and open for extensibility
* `Transaction.addLogger()` function introduced as replacement to `logger.addLogger()` approach
* Strings will be validated against column max length before inserting to database ([#300](https://github.com/JetBrains/Exposed/issues/300))
* Overriding the fetch size for a Query ([#327](https://github.com/JetBrains/Exposed/pull/327)) 

Bug fixes:
* Extended sql exception logging available only in debug mode
* [PostgreSQL] Table with `customEnumeration` column doesn't work with Entity/DAO API ([#340](https://github.com/JetBrains/Exposed/issues/340))
* Table with composite key created only with specific prop order ([#343](https://github.com/JetBrains/Exposed/issues/343))
* allTableNames in VendorDialect returns only from current database ([#339](https://github.com/JetBrains/Exposed/issues/339))
* "ORA-00972: identifier is too long" on creating table with long name

# 0.10.3
Features:
* Floating point columns
* Check constraint functionallity (kudos to @SackCastellon)
* Possibility to provide custom names for contraints and indexes (thanks to @mduesterhoeft)
* Added support to delete with limit and offset (thanks  @Mon_chi for initial PR)
