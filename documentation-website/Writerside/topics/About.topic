       title="Exposed, an ORM framework for Kotlin" id="About">
    <p>
        Exposed is a lightweight SQL library on top of a JDBC driver for the Kotlin programming language. It offers
        two approaches for database access: the Domain-Specific Language (DSL) API and the Data Access Object (DAO) API.
    </p>
    <p>
        The Domain-Specific Language (DSL) API of Exposed provides a Kotlin-based abstraction for interacting with databases
        . It closely <a href="DSL-CRUD-operations.topic">mirrors actual SQL statements</a>, allowing you to work
        with familiar SQL concepts while benefiting from the type safety that Kotlin offers.
    </p>
    <p>
        <a href="Deep-Dive-into-DAO.md">The Data Access Object (DAO) API</a> of Exposed provides an object-oriented approach for interacting with a database,
        similar to traditional Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) frameworks like Hibernate.
        This API is less verbose and provides a more intuitive and Kotlin-centric way to interact with your database.
    </p>
    <p>
        Exposed's flexibility allows you to choose the approach that best suits your project's needs, whether you
        prefer the direct control of SQL with the DSL API or the higher-level abstraction of the DAO API.
    </p>
    <p>
        The official mascot of Exposed is the cuttlefish, which is well-known for its outstanding mimicry ability that enables it
        to blend seamlessly into any environment. Similar to its mascot, Exposed can be used to mimic a variety of
        database engines, which helps you to build applications without dependencies on any specific database engine
        and to switch between them with very little or no changes.
