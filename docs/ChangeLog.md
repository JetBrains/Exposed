# 0.44.0
Infrastructure:
* Kotlin 1.9.10
* Kotlin Coroutines 1.7.3
* log4j2 2.20.0
* h2-database driver 2.2.220
* MariaDB driver 2.7.9 and 3.1.4
* MySQL driver 8.0.30
* PostgreSQL driver 42.6.0
* SQLite driver 3.43.0.0
* Spring Framework 6.0.11
* Spring Boot 3.1.3

Breaking changes:
* `SpringTransactionManager` no longer extends `DataSourceTransactionManager`; instead, it directly extends `AbstractPlatformTransactionManager`.
  The class also no longer implements the Exposed interface `TransactionManager`, as transaction operations are instead delegated to Spring.
* `spring-transaction` and `exposed-spring-boot-starter` modules now use Spring Framework 6.0 and Spring Boot 3.0, which require Java 17 as a minimum version.
* A table that is created with a keyword identifier now logs a warning that the identifier's case may be lost when it is automatically quoted in generated SQL.
  `DatabaseConfig` now includes the property `preserveKeywordCasing`, which can be set to `true` to remove these warnings and to ensure that the identifier matches the exact case used.

# 0.41.1
Infrastructure:
* Kotlin 1.7.21 
* spring-security-crypto 5.7.3
* Few improvements in text infrastructure with help of [valery1707](https://github.com/valery1707)

Deprecations:
* `StatementInterceprot.afterCommit` and `StatementInterceptor.afterRollback` without `transaction` parameter have ERROR deprecation level
* `Column<*>.autoIncSeqName` has HIDDEN deprecation level
* `Database.connect` with `datasource: ConnectionPoolDataSource` parameter has HIDDEN deprecation level
* `SchemaUtils.createFKey` with `reference: Column<*>` parameter has ERROR deprecation level
* `Sequence.nextVal` has ERROR deprecation level
* `SqlExpressionBuilderClass` has ERROR deprecation level
* `CurrentDateTime()`  has ERROR deprecation level 

Feature:
* [PostgreSQL] `NOWAIT/SKIP LOCKED` modes supported in all kinds of `FOR UPDATE`. Also, it's now possible to provide tables to be locked ([#1623](https://github.com/JetBrains/Exposed/issues/1623)) 
*`ExposedBlob` now wraps `InputStream` instead of `ByteArray` that can lead to significant memory improvements ([#1617](https://github.com/JetBrains/Exposed/issues/1617))
* [H2] All [compatibility modes](http://www.h2database.com/html/features.html#compatibility) are fully supported for known dialects ([#1615](https://github.com/JetBrains/Exposed/issues/1615))
* `mod`/`rem` operations with `EntityID` expressions supported with help of [Alexey Soshin](https://github.com/AlexeySoshin) ([#1597](https://github.com/JetBrains/Exposed/issues/1597))

Bug Fixes:
* Don't alert entity hook subscribers while inserting new entities as it can lead to entity cache misses
* `clientDefault` should allow nullable values ([#1617](https://github.com/JetBrains/Exposed/issues/1617)). Reported and fixed by [terminalnode](https://github.com/terminalnode)
* [Oracle] Use VARCHAR2 column for VarCharColumnType ([#1628](https://github.com/JetBrains/Exposed/issues/1628)). Reported and fixed by [dakriy](https://github.com/dakriy)
* [PostgreSQL] Correct comparison of defaults for String type columns ([#1587](https://github.com/JetBrains/Exposed/issues/1587)). Resolved by [Alexey Soshin](https://github.com/AlexeySoshin)
* Transaction was initialized with a wrong isolation level ([#1575](https://github.com/JetBrains/Exposed/issues/1575))

# 0.40.1
Infrastructure:
* Kotlin 1.7.20

Feature:
* Read-only transactions/connections support. Read-Only option can be set on all levels (via `DatabaseConfig`, `transaction`, `TransactionManager`). Thanks [Alex Shubert](https://github.com/lure) for the improvement
* `Table.deleteWhere` now captures receiver table and allows to omit the table in a lambda. Greetings to [Alexey Soshin](https://github.com/AlexeySoshin) for the first PR in the project!  
    * **Breaking change**: Code using `deleteWhere` with `eq` will need to `import org.jetbrains.exposed.sql.SqlExpressionBuilder.eq`.
      Lambdas previously using an implicit `it` reference from an outer scope will also need to introduce an explicit name to access that binding.
* New `mediumText` and `largeText` columns were introduced by [Alex Shubert](https://github.com/lure) to allow use more suitable data types for databases where they are supported.
* `ForUpdateOption` (like `ForUpdateOption.PostgreSQL.ForKeyShare`) added for more flexible management of locks in your `SELECT` queries. You can set it as a parameter via `Query.forUpdate` function. Another kudos goes to [Alex Shubert](https://github.com/lure)
* Preserve a colection type for `Iterable.with()` function 
* `LazySizedCollection` can be checked for loaded data with `LazySizedCollection.isLoaded()`. Added by [unbearables](https://github.com/unbearables)

Bug Fixes:
* [Regression] `NoSuchMethod` error: `long kotlin.time.TimeSource$Monotonic.markNow` ([#1556](https://github.com/JetBrains/Exposed/issues/1540)) 
* `insertIgnoreAndGet` must explicitly mark failed insert on conflicts. Fixed by [Alex Shubert](https://github.com/lure) in PR ([#1584](https://github.com/JetBrains/Exposed/issues/1584))
* Comma is missing in `UPDATE` with multiple tables ([#1595](https://github.com/JetBrains/Exposed/issues/1595))
* `suspendedTransaction` should accept `CoroutineContext` instead of `CourutineDispatcher` was fixed by [rasharab](https://github.com/rasharab) in PR ([#1515](https://github.com/JetBrains/Exposed/issues/1515))
* [MySQL/MariaDB] `REPLACE` fails when `Expression` used as a replacement parameter. Thank you [Tiscs](https://github.com/Tiscs) for the fix.
* `EntityClass#wramUpReferences` should cache reference of referrer. Located and fixed by [Joddev](https://github.com/Joddev).  
* `NullPointerException` when IdTable with overridden tableName is defined ([#1588](https://github.com/JetBrains/Exposed/issues/1588))
* `SchemaUtils.createMissingTablesAndColumns` raises `NoSuchElementException` ([#1568](https://github.com/JetBrains/Exposed/issues/1568))
* Better handling of tables with names covered with quotes. Issue [#1550](https://github.com/JetBrains/Exposed/issues/1550) resolved by [Alexey Soshin](https://github.com/AlexeySoshin). 

# 0.39.2

# 0.39.1
Infrastructure:
* Kotlin 1.7.10
* Kotlin Coroutines 1.6.4
* Datetime/Timestamp comparison test improvements by [Jerbell](https://github.com/Jerbell)  

Feature:
* `Transaction` added into `afterCommit` and `afterRollback` in `StatementInterceptor` ([#1530](https://github.com/JetBrains/Exposed/issues/1530)). PR by [rsromanowski](https://github.com/rsromanowski) 
* `andIfNotNull` and `orIfNotNull` operators was added by [xJoeWoo](https://github.com/xJoeWoo) to perform logical operations with nullable condition
* `like/notLike` support providing escape character when used with `LikePattern`. Improvement contributed by [spand](https://github.com/spand)
* `CurrentDate` function introduced by [naftalmm](https://github.com/naftalmm)
* Better representation of long query in logs 

Bug Fixes:
* `neq` incorrectly resolved with nullable values  ([#1489](https://github.com/JetBrains/Exposed/issues/1489))
* `newSuspendedTransaction` now accepts generic `CoroutineContext` instead of `CoroutineDispatcher`, fixed by [rasharab](https://github.com/rasharab)

# 0.38.2
Infrastructure:
* Kotlin Coroutines 1.6.1
* slf4j 1.7.36
* log4j2 2.17.2
* h2-database 2.1.212
* MaridDB driver 2.7.5
* MySQL driver 8.0.28
* PostgreSQL driver 42.3.3

Feature:
* New `optimizedLoad` param introduced for `EntityClass.warmUpLinkedReferences`. 
It will force to make to two queries to load ids and referenced entities separately.
Can be useful when references target the same entities. That will prevent from loading them multiple times 
(per each reference row) and will require less memory/bandwidth for "heavy" entities (with a lot of columns or columns with huge data in it)

Bug Fixes:
* Regression on 0.38.1 - SpringTransactionManager requires DatabaseConfig ([#1488](https://github.com/JetBrains/Exposed/issues/1488))
* `inList`/`notInList` doesn't work with list of EntityIDs ([#1490](https://github.com/JetBrains/Exposed/issues/1490))

* Exposed can be build on Java 17+ (`MaxPermSize` is optional in build scripts), thanks to [MrPowerGamerBR](https://github.com/MrPowerGamerBR)

Feature:
* New `exposed-crypt` module added. Module contains two new `encryptedVarchar` and `encryptedBinary` columns which allows to store encrypted values in database and encode/decode them on client. 
  Check [`SelectTests.test encryptedColumnType with a string`](https://github.com/JetBrains/Exposed/blob/0.38.1/exposed-tests/src/test/kotlin/org/jetbrains/exposed/sql/tests/shared/dml/SelectTests.kt#L264) test for the sample usage 
* Allow to pass DatabaseConfig in SpringTransactionManager. PR by [stengvac](https://github.com/stengvac)
* `CompoundBooleanOp` (`AndOp` and `OrOp`) is sealed class now

    val idB = integer("id_b")
    override val primaryKey = PrimaryKey(idA, idB)
}

object ChildTable : Table("child1") {
    val idA = integer("id_a")
    val idB = integer("id_b")

    init {
        foreignKey(
            idA, idB,
            target = ParentTable.primaryKey,
            onUpdate = ReferenceOption.RESTRICT,
            onDelete = ReferenceOption.RESTRICT,
            name = "MyForeignKey1"
        )
        
        // or
        foreignKey(
            idA to ParentTable.idA, idB to ParentTable.idB,
            onUpdate = ReferenceOption.RESTRICT,
            onDelete = ReferenceOption.RESTRICT,
            name = "MyForeignKey1"
        ) 
    }
}

```
* Now it's possible to use embedded entity initialization like:
```kotlin

        }
        category = Category.new {
            title = "Parent Category"
        }
    }
    category = Category.new {
        title = "Child Category"
    }

    optCategory = parent!!.category
}
```

* A new way to configure common settings for a database via `DatabaseConfig` ():
```kotlin
// An example with current available settings and their defaults
val dbConfig = DatabaseConfig {
    sqlLogger = Slf4jSqlDebugLogger
    useNestedTransactions = false
    defaultFetchSize = null // unlimited
    defaultIsolationLevel = -1 // DB specific
    defaultRepetitionAttempts = 3
    warnLongQueriesDuration = null // no long query tracing
    maxEntitiesToStoreInCachePerEntity = Int.MAX_VALUE // unlimited 
    keepLoadedReferencesOutOfTransaction = false
}
// databaseConfig available on each connect/connectPool functions
val database = Database.connect(datasource, databaseConfig = databaseConfig)
